grunt-source-jslib
====================

A premade Grunt environment to build JavaScript libraries with CoffeeScript,
utilizing [Grunt Source](https://github.com/jpillora/grunt-source).

## Features

Provides a `default` task which:

1. Assumes you have `src/` directory
1. Checks if there are `.coffee` files in `src/`
1. If CoffeeScript, then compile all `src/*.coffee` into `dist/<source.name>.js`
1. If JavaScript, then concat all `src/*.js` into `dist/<source.name>.js`
1. Uglify result into `dist/<source.name>.min.js`

## Features

* Compile your CoffeeScript
* Minified version

## Usage

* Install Grunt Source http://github.com/jpillora/grunt-source

* Create a `Gruntsource.json`:

  ``` json
  {
    "name": "...",
    "title": "...",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "homepage": "https://github.com/jpillora/...",
    "author": "Jaime Pillora <dev@jpillora.com>",
    "source": "~/Code/JavaScript/grunt-source-jslib",
    "repo": "https://github.com/jpillora/grunt-source-jslib.git",
    "jquery": false,
    "bower": true
  }
  ```
    * `jquery` denotes whether to create jQuery plugin manifest
    * `bower` denotes whether to create bower manifest

* Optionally create a `vendor/` directory with some `*.js` files

* Create `src/` directory with some `*.js|coffee` files

* Run `grunt-source`

## Grunt Options

* Web Server `--server=<port>`
* Live Reload `--livereload=false`
* Show Filesize Report `--report=true`

## Contributing

1. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/jpillora/grunt-source-jslib)
2. Edit your `GruntSource.json` file's `repo` to be the new Git URL
3. Edit your `GruntSource.json` file's `source` to reference a new directory
4. Rerun `grunt-source`
5. Push your changes
6. Pull-request for others to enjoy

## Todo

* Come up with a `test` task which applies to most JS libraries
